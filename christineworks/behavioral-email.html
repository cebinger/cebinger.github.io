<h3>Overview</h3>
<p> The most requested feature in a customer study was to make it possible to re-buy a Groupon voucher again (as existing deal-structures did not allow for more than one purchase per customer.)  I worked with sales to restructure deals to make them eligible for repurchase, and paired up with business intelligence to create a marketing campaign that drove awareness of this new offering.</p>

	<h3>Buy it Again Email</h3>
	<br>
	<h6>Completely driven by relevance calls, the Buy it Again email fatured a deal that a customer had purchased in the past, redeemed, and hit a pre-determined timeframe for re-purchase.  Similar deal-types were also featured in the bottom of the email to drive discovery.
