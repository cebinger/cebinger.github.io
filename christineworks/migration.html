	<h3>Overview</h3>
	<p>Groupon acquired LivingSocial in November 2016 and needed to migrate all site, email and app operations to the Groupon platform by June 2017.  As employee #2 on the Groupon side, I played quarterback for all things merchandising, email and campaign related while hiring and training a team of marketing coordinators.  I’d consider it the equivalent of running an ultra-marathon… but for websites!</p>

<div class="objectives">
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Build initial set of landing pages and merchandised assets for all themed and promotional campaigns</li>
	<li>Rebuild email program for Local, Goods, Travel and Cross-Channel businesses on Groupon platform</li>
	<li>QA email, site and app-messaging when operations migrated to Groupon system</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="deliverables">
<h3>Deliverables</h3>
	<p><strong>Landing Pages & Merchandising Assets:</strong> In order to drive customers to relevant inventory and landing pages, I analyzed past campaign and deal performance to create a dynamic set of experiences for the customer. I then kicked-off creative briefs, curated inventory and built the pages and set up merchandised assets on the Groupon CMS system</p>
	<br>
	<p><strong>Email Programs:</strong> I to worked ensure that the successful aspects of the existing LivingSocial email strategy were maintained while also incorporating proven tactics from the new Groupon email platform.  I then proceeded to rebuild templates, inventory parameters, cadence and audience segmentation for all emails.  Phew!  I’m tired just rewriting this.</p>
	<br>
	<p><strong>QA:</strong>  Leading up to and on the day of relaunch, I worked with teams across the board to troubleshoot and lock-down marketing and merchandising messaging on the new platform. Some of the teams I worked with included app operations, email, UX, deliverability and mobile-web teams</p>
</ul>
