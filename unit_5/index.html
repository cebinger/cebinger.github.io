                <h3>Why I do what I do</h3>
                  <p>I’ve spent the past 8 years working with both enterprise eCommerce companies and start-ups in a variety of roles, and I love the digital aspect of the business.  I have learned to adapt quickly, be resourceful, develop strong partnerships across various teams and deeply appreciate the customer’s opinion.
                  I get the most jazzed about bringing projects to life and rolling up my sleeves to make it happen.  From launching new brands to rebuilding CRM programs, I’ve found that success comes from data based-decisions, a lot of leg-work and leveraging the expertise of others.</p>
